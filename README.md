# Role-Based Ticketing System

---

## Overview

The **Role-Based Ticketing System** is a full-stack web application designed to manage support tickets with distinct roles for users and admins. Users can create and view their tickets, while admins can manage all tickets, including updating statuses. Built with a React frontend and a Node.js backend, this project showcases role-based access control, real-time state management, and a user-friendly interface.
